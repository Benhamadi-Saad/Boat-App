INSERT INTO BOAT (ID,name,description) VALUES (1,'TITANIC','RMS Titanic was a British passenger operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship[a] and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date.[4] With much public attention in the aftermath the disaster has since been the material of many artistic works and a founding material of the disaster film genre. RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, chief naval architect of the shipyard at the time, died in the disaster.')
INSERT INTO BOAT (ID,name,description) VALUES (2,'MONTREUX','The oldest boat in the CGN fleet! Despite being the oldest in the Belle Epoque fleet, it is equipped with the most recent 21st century steam engine, with remote control from the bridge and wheelhouse, a world first! The boat is greatly appreciated especially for its gourmet evening cruises between Lausanne and Yvoire. CGN’s first Belle Epoque boat was completely renovated between 1998 and 2001. A feature of its first class lounge: magnificent paneling from another steamboat, the VALAIS, which disappeared in 2003.')
INSERT INTO BOAT (ID, name,description) VALUES (3,'SIMPLON','Along with the LA SUISSE the largest in the fleet, this great boat impresses by the power and responsiveness of its engine and is the favorite of many "aficionados" who often come from very far away for a cruise on it. It is the first CGN steamboat with the boiler at the rear and the engine at the front, which changes the boat’s silhouette due to the positioning of its smokestack. After two partial renovations in 2005 and 2011, it will still need a last major renovation in 2022-2023. The lounge offers a fine example of neo-classical art with paneling in variegated maple.')
